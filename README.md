<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
According to LinkedIn Talent Connect 2018, 75% of hiring managers
consider behavioral skills as vital as technical skills in candidate
evaluations. In the context of job interviews, these behavioral
attributes hold significant weight, shaping how candidates are
assessed. However, a notable challenge persists â€“ individuals
encounter difficulty in improving these crucial skills, resulting in less-than ideal interview performances and missed chances for personal
and professional development.

<h3>Our Solution</h3>
Our solution could significantly enhance interviewees' preparation by
providing detailed and nuanced feedback on aspects such as
friendliness, excitement, engagement, structured answers, and
calmness. This, in turn, could lead to improved interview
performance, increased self-awareness, and better overall
communication skills <br><br>

Here is what we did, summed up:
